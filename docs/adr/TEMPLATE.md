<!--
Be concise and stick to the point while documenting a decision, but write in full sentences and include all necessary information. Think of the format almost like a blog post. This makes it easier for people to read and understand.

If you think a section is unnecessary, feel free to omit it - however keep in mind that `Context` and `Decision` are likely critical.
