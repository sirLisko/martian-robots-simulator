# 4. Use of Vitest for Testing

Date: 2025-01-31

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Martian Robots Simulator requires unit tests to ensure the correctness of the robot deployment logic. A modern testing framework with built-in mocking utilities is preferred to reduce dependencies and improve maintainability.

## Decision

Use Vitest for unit testing.

## Consequences

- **Pros**:

  - Vitest is modern, fast, and lightweight.
  - Excellent TypeScript support and integration with modern tooling.
  - Built-in mocking utilities reduce the need for additional dependencies.

- **Cons**:
  - Requires familiarity with Vitest's API (though it is similar to Jest).
