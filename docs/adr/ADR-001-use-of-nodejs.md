# 1. Use of Node.js

Date: 2025-01-31

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Martian Robots Simulator requires a runtime environment to execute the simulation logic and provide a command-line interface (CLI). The project needs a lightweight, fast, and widely supported runtime that is well-suited for building CLI tools and handling asynchronous operations.

## Decision

Use Node.js as the runtime environment for the Martian Robots.

## Consequences

- **Pros**:

  - **Lightweight and Fast**: Node.js is optimized for I/O-heavy operations, making it ideal for CLI applications.

  - **Large Ecosystem**: Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools (e.g., `vitest`, `prompts`, `chalk`) that simplify development.

  - **Cross-Platform**: Node.js runs on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), ensuring broad compatibility.

  - **Asynchronous by Default**: Node.jsâ€™s event-driven architecture is well-suited for handling multiple robots or simulations concurrently.

- **Cons**:

  - **Single-Threaded**: Node.js is single-threaded, which could limit performance for CPU-intensive tasks (though this is not a concern for this project).

  - **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with Node.js may need time to learn its asynchronous programming model.
