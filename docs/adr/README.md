# Architecture Decision Records

We have a collection of ADRs that document the decisions we make while building New Resolve. We use a format based on this blog post, with some slight tweaks: <http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions>

Each architectural decision should be contained in an ad hoc Markdown file, named following the pattern `ADR-XXX-title-in-kebab-case.md`, where `XXX` is an incremental number. The format of the content should follow the template in `TEMPLATE.md`.
