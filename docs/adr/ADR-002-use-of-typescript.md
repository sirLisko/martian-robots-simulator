# 1. Use of Typescript

Date: 2025-01-31

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Martian Robots Simulator involves complex logic for robot movements, grid boundaries, and input validation. Ensuring type safety and catching errors at compile time is critical to avoid runtime issues and improve maintainability.

## Decision

Use **TypeScript** instead of plain JavaScript for the Martian Robot Simulator.

## Consequences

- **Pros**:

  - **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

  - **Improved Developer Experience**: TypeScript offers autocompletion, type hints, and better tooling, making development faster and more efficient.

  - **Easier Refactoring**: Explicit types make the codebase easier to refactor and maintain.

  - **Better Collaboration**: TypeScriptâ€™s type system makes it easier for teams to understand and work with the code.

- **Cons**:

  - **Build Step**: TypeScript requires a build step to compile into JavaScript, adding complexity to the development process.

  - **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with TypeScript may need time to learn its features and syntax.
